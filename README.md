# Barliman-iOS
A port of @webyrd's Barliman code synthesis IDE for iOS. Initially created for my CSCI S-65 Advanced Mobile Application Development Using Swift and iOS class at Harvard Summer School.

### Barliman
My project depends on a backend API that is a modified version of [Barliman](https://github.com/webyrd/Barliman) (MIT Licensed).

My [Barliman Backend API can be found here](https://github.com/benjenkinsv95/barliman-api), that said, I would treat it as a library, and not part of this assignment directly. Hence the separate repository.
